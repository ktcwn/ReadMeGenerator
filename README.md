# Description

This application features a ReadMe generator that allows developers to easily write a properly formatted ReadMe to their GitHub.

## Installation

No additional packages are needed to install

## Usage

I personally used my ReadMe generator to generate this readme attached to my files. It is great to use because it is already formatted for a readme, with proper headers, indentions, etc.
